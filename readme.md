## Backend and Frontend Details

This project is built with a clear separation between the backend and frontend:

- **Backend (Django):**  
  The backend is developed using Django, a powerful Python web framework. Django handles the application's business logic, database management, authentication, and provides RESTful API endpoints for the frontend. It processes requests from the frontend, performs necessary operations, and returns responses, ensuring data is managed securely and efficiently.

- **Frontend (React):**  
  The frontend is built with React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React manages the user experience in the browser, presenting data and capturing user input. It communicates with the Django backend via HTTP requests (such as REST APIs), allowing for dynamic and responsive interfaces.

Together, Django and React provide a robust, scalable, and maintainable architecture: Django powers the backend logic and data management, while React delivers a modern, interactive frontend experience.
